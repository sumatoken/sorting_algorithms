## Building and Running

You'll need CMake to build this project. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using a package manager.

For instance, on macOS you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake
```

Then, from the root of the project, you can generate the Makefile and compile the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
